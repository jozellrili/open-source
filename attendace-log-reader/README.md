# attendance-log-reader

###### Note:
A basic app to read attendance log file I created for my friend which she uses during her payroll works.

### How to use:
1. Open the at-log reader using any browser with javascript enabled.
2. Click the `Read File` button and a file explorer will open. 
3. Select the .dat file you want to read.
4. The name of the file and the rows detected will display together with filter inputs.

### Filter Result:
Input the Employee Id number and the date range you want to filter then click the `Filter` button to filter the result.

### Reset Filters:
Click the `Reset` button to clear the filters and the table will hide.

### Change Log (WIP)
* v1 - initial application with starting features
* v2 - UI Changes
* v2.01 - Fixed issue of no results when filtering logs for the month of oct - dec
